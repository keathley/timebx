# Timebx

Timebx is just another TODO list.  But its MY todo list.

TL;DR - Install and start using by running this:

    $ scripts/bootstrap

## About

I need deadlines.  Timebx is how I do that.  I add todo's and give myself a finite amount of time to get each todo done.  It's written in React and uses localstorage for persistance.  It ships with a public folder so you can run it from whatever webserver you want.  I use pow locally: http://pow.cx/.

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/spcy3r/timebx
    $ npm install
    $ gulp
    $ httpster -d public/

You should now be ready to roll.

Everything is shipped in a public directory so that it works out of the box with pow: http://pow.cx/.
